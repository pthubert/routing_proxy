                 IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Routing Proxy
         draft-levy-abegnoli-6man-nd-stateless-routing-proxy-00

Abstract

   A legacy or incorrect host implementation may assume an on-link
   prefix on an interface where it owns an address that matches the
   prefix.  This mistake may prevent connectivity on networks where this
   is not the case, e.g., when the physical or logical connectivity of
   the network does not allow transitive connectivity, in which case all
   the traffic should transit via the router.  This document proposes a
   stateless routing proxy operation in the router to force a "not-on-
   link" behavior on the misbehaving host and attract all the packets to
   the router.

1.  Introduction

   Section 5.2 of "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)" [RFC4861] describes a
   conceptual sending algorithm for the host stack, which operation
   differs whether a destination is on-link or off-link, affecting the
   selection of the next hop to which to forward a packet.  In the
   former case, the host lookups the address up over the link, whereas
   in the latter, the host simply forwards to the default router.  While
   on-link determination is explicitly specified through a variety of
   criteria, there is no signaling for off-link and a prefix that not
   known as being on-link may still be on-link or off-link, so the host
   behavior is not clearly defined.  In particular, a router on the link
   can refrain from announcing that a prefix is on-link, but it has no
   authoritative way to declare that the prefix is off-link, and whether
   to adopt an off-link or an on-link behavior by default is left to the
   host decision and stack implementation.

   This is problematic in the case of non-broacast multi-access (NBMA)
   links that was accepted to be left "for further study" at the time of
   [RFC4861].  "Architecture and Framework for IPv6 over Non-Broadcast
   Access" [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless] presents a number of NBMA
   situations, including wireless access and meshes, Low-Power Lossy
   Networks, and multi-site overlays, where the physical or logical
   characteristics of the subnet mandates an off-link behavior by the
   hosts, even when the destination is in the same subnet as the sender.
   In these cases, a host that fails to adopt the off-link behavior is
   likely to attempt link-layer address resolution and fail to forward
   traffic via a router.

Internet-Draft            IPv6 ND Routing Proxy                June 2023


   [RFC4943] provides historical and background information behind the
   removal of the "on-link assumption" from the conceptual host sending
   algorithm defined in [RFC4861], in particular in the case whether the
   host is not aware of a default router.  On that basis, [RFC5942]
   clarifies the relationship between subnet and link and update
   [RFC4861] to make off-link behavior the default and mandate on-link
   behavior to be driven by explicit means.

   However, legacy or non-complient stack implementations may continue
   to this day to assume that a prefix is on-link by default, leading to
   connectivity failures.  This document proposes a stateless ND
   routing-proxy operation (see section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-over-wireless]) as a stateless variation of the
   ND routing-proxy function defined in section 2.2 of [RFC8929].
   enabling the router to obtain an off-link behavior from such stacks,
   by forcing hosts that attempt a link-layer address resolution by
   default to forward all their traffic to their default router.  The
   routing proxy function is co-located with the Router, listens to ND
   messages sent on the link and, when appropriate, responds with NA
   announcing self as the owner of the address to attract the traffic.

3.  Operations

   Assuming that two hosts sharing a common prefix can only communicate
   with each other via the router, due to physical or logical network
   constrains, as shown in Figure 1, the first action for the router
   would be to clear the L-flag for this prefix.  However, it has been
   observed that some hosts implementations will continue to try to
   resolve destination within that prefix and as a consequence, will be
   unable to establish connectivity with each other.

   Note that this document does not cover the use cases where the hosts
   are not isolated from each other, and continue to run NDP on a prefix
   announced by the router as not on-link.

                             Figure 1: Topology

   There are three types of NS that the proxy can get:

   1.  NS lookup: Multicast, sent from the node's LLA to the SNMA

   2.  NS NUD: Unicast, sent from the node's LLA to the target

   3.  NS DAD: Multicast, sent from the unspecified address to the SNMA

   NS DAD are ignored by the Proxy (passed to the router).  Assuming the
   physical or logical topology does not provide layer-2 connectivity
   between hosts, another type of proxy (DAD-proxy, specified in
   [RFC6957] is required to detect and handle duplications.

   NS Lookup and NS NUD are responded unconditionally by the proxy.  The
   response always carries the Router MAC in a TLLA option.  In case the
   entry is not in router's ND cache, and upon receiving data packets
   from the host, the router will initiate address resolution before
   forwarding.  The end result is going to be identical to a host
   implementing "not on-link" behavior.  This flow is illustrated in
   Figure 2.

                             Figure 2: NS flow

   When the proxy sends the NA, the R/S/O flags are set as specified
   below:

   *  S flag should be on (response to a solicitation)

   *  O flag should be on (to update sender's cache, in case the MAC has
      changed)

   *  R flag should be on if and only if the target is the router
      address, off otherwise.
